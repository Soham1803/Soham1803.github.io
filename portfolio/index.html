        <h2>🧑‍💻 Projects</h2>
        <p>
          <b>🔷<u>DRUM-PAD:</u></b><br>
          My first project was a web based DRUM-PAD 🥁 using javascript and off course HTML-CSS. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>🔷<u>Quiz-Generator:</u></b><br>
          As a capstone project, a part of our college curriculum, we as a team built a fully functional web-based Quiz-Generator, which would allow an educator to create multiple choice quizzes in an interactive way without any need of programming knowledge. I learnt the backend stuff in the process. We used Django as our tool for the backend.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>🔷<u>Helmet detection and number plate capturing program:</u></b><br>
          Our recent work was a project as our second capstone project. A helmet detector using OpenCV python and Deep-learning object detection algorithm YOLOv5. My specific contribution was dataset collection and model training. The program would detect whether the rider is wearing a helmet or not and capture and save the cropped image of the number plate of the rider not wearing a helmet. <br>
